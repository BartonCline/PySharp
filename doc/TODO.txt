TODO list
=========

For PythonNet 2.0 
-----------------

 * Implement support for ModulePropertyAttribute.

 * Replace CLRModule.preload code with ModulePropertyAttribute specific code.
 
 * Deprecate implicit loading of assemblies

 * Add support for implicit calls to overloaded methods. 
   OverloadedMethod[string, int]("egg", 42) works
   OverloadedMethod("egg", 42) does NOT work

 * Debug failing unit tests under Mono and report them if they are caused
   by incompatibilities in Mono. 

Future and nice-to-have features
--------------------------------

 * Add support for Python's debug builds. Debug builds have additional fields
   in the struct. Py_DEBUG implies Py_TRACE_REFS and Py_REF_DEBUG which changes
   the memory address of every struct using PyObject and PyVarObject. One has to
   fix the offsets in interops.cs and Decref() and Incref() in runtime.cs, maybe
   more.

 * Support Python 2.6. The most important feature I was able to isolate is the
   PyType_FastSubclass macro and related TypeFlags in interops.cs.

 * Let's talk to the Debian and Ubuntu maintainers for Python in order to convince
   them to build Python with --enable-shared. Ubuntu's Python is semi static and not
   linked against libpython2.x.so. This causes trouble with clr.so.
